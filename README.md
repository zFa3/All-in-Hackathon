This is our submission in the All in Hackathon hosted by MLH

The All in Hackathon or the "hackathon" is a group activity where people work together to create a project which they submit within 24 hours.

### INSPIRATION ###

We made this project because around our neighborhood,
we often see many people neglecting the environment, so
we decided to create a website that brings awareness to
the impacts that we can have. This project is based off
the many carbon footprint calculators found on the internet

### HOW TO RUN ###
To run this program, you need to download:
Code within this repository
Taipy (with pip install Taipy)

Go into carbon_awareness folder and
run main.py as an executable
