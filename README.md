This is our submission in the All in Open Source Hackathon hosted by MLH

The All in Hackathon or the "hackathon" is a 
group activity where people work together to create 
a project which they submit within 24 hours.

### INSPIRATION ###

We made this project because around our neighborhood,
we often see many people neglecting the environment, so
we decided to create a website that brings awareness to
the impacts that we can have. This project is based off
the many carbon footprint calculators found on the internet

### CHALLENGES ###

During the 24 hours we had to create a project, there were
multiple issues that we ran into, the main one being experimenting
with TaiPy since it was new to us. Other challenges includes difficulty
finding reliable information on the web about carbon footprint calculation
and creating images/styling with CSS

### HOW TO RUN ###

To run this program, you need to download:
Code within this repository
Taipy (with pip install Taipy)

Go into carbon_awareness folder and
run main.py as an executable
