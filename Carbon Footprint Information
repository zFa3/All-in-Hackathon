Why do you want to reduce your carbon footprint?

Your carbon footprint holds a huge part in increasing global warming and the effect of climate change. The negative impacts that you help increase every day include:

  1. Rising temperatures which can lead to many plants and animals becoming extinct. 
  2. Increased drought. This can lead to countless communities losing their source of water and food. Several countries in Africa or other places near the 
     equator have already felt extreme impacts from drought
  3. Rising sea-levels. This has already led to millions of people being forced to leave their coastal-communities. Places like Venice are also at 
     risk as the sea level is already so high that the bases of buildings are completely underwater
  4. Floods. Many people have lost their homes and unfortunately, many people have drowned or passed away due to floods. This includes places like Bangladesh and India. 
  5. Lack of food. Manu plants and animals can become extinct. This leads to large food sources deplenishing and slowly disappearing. 
  6. Wildfires. Wildfires harm habitats and force animals to leave. These animals can become extinct and we end up losing large amounts of trees which are vital 
     to replenishing oxygen. 
  7. Trauma. A product of global warming that is overlooked, but trauma is a large side effect of global warming. It can come from traumatic 
     experiences such as fires, floods, storms and more. This leads to worsening mental health and can lead to suicide.
